# AlgoNFTMinter
I started initial work on this application to give Algorand NFT creators a desktop tool with a UI to easily manage, mint, and update their NFTs.
As more cloud based minting services roll out, it has become apparent that the need for a desktop app would be pretty niche.
I have stopped active development on this project but am going to leave the repo up. The examples can be used for future projects that use the Algorand blockchain
The buttons on the Mint form simply serve as triggers for different actions I was building

Required packages:
```
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.FileExtensions
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
Algorand
Pinata.Client
sqlite-net-pcl
```
